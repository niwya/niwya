### âœ¨ Bonjour âœ¨

My name is ChloÃ©, and I'm an engineer. I like dance, photography and gaming. I'm a die-hard fan of the Portal series. I'm obsessed with cheese (well - I'm French :fr:, so that's self-explanatory). I like planes, UAVs, and autonomous cars. 

ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on...
- ![30%](https://progress-bar.dev/30) Autonomous plant watering system (ESP-32, C/C++)
- ![30%](https://progress-bar.dev/30) Multicurrency bill splitter (C++)

ðŸ”­ Some of my fun past projects are...
- [x] Cheezam - a cheese classifier
- [x] Autonomous Waiter - a knowledge base and minimal planning module for a robot working in a restaurant
