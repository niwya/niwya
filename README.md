## ‚ú® Bonjour ‚ú®

My name is Chlo√©, and I'm an engineer. I like dance, photography and gaming. I'm a die-hard fan of the Portal series. I'm obsessed with cheese (well - I'm French, so that's self-explanatory). I like planes, UAVs, and autonomous cars. I love learning - about anything and everything. I'm self-teching myself japanese right now. But enough facts, more code:

### :gear: I'm currently working on...
- ![60%](https://progress-bar.dev/60) Autonomous plant watering system (ESP-32, C/C++)
- 
See [the repo's README](https://github.com/niwya/autonomous-plant-watering) for details about the to-do list.  

- ![50%](https://progress-bar.dev/50) Multicurrency bill splitter (C++)
- [X] Implement base classes
- [ ] Implement all class methods
- [ ] Integrate unit testing and make it work with CMake
- [X] Integrate CMake to compile/link/build
- [ ] Finish implementing the main program

For a nicer user experience:
- [ ] Design a GUI using Qt

### :heavy_check_mark: Some of my fun past projects are...
- [x] Cheezam - a cheese classifier
- [x] Autonomous Waiter - a knowledge base and minimal planning module for a robot working in a restaurant

### :thought_balloon: Some projects ideas for the future...
- [Chicago CTA Bus Tracker](https://www.transitchicago.com/developers/) (to know buses alternate routes when there is roadwork planned on their usual path)
- [Google Smartphone Decimeter Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/smartphone-decimeter-2022) + meddling a bit more with [GnssLogger](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.location.gps.gnsslogger)
- VALORANT Bot using Computer Vision techniques
- Play around with the [Cityscapes dataset](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/)
